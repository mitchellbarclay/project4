					I've been starting to form some ideas for where I want to go with project 4

					Idea 1: Seeing as the idea behind an internet Yama-ichi is that it's a black market party, made me think about our ideas of a "black market" and it's association with dodgy things like organ trading or drugs. One idea I have is selling 3D models of drugs or organs on CD or USB drive or something. Another idea is have a website with different pages you can choose that simulates being on different drugs. <br><br>

					Idea 2: A physical meme generator, the idea being the customer could choose a print of a miscellaneous image and then attach a caption of their choice. This could be a critique on typical meme culture which involves copy paste and a template, without the need for much thought or skill. <br><br>

					Idea 3: A physical piratebay or torrent website, selling USB drives with pirated copies of the bachelor on them or something stupid like that. Could be a fun idea, not sure how I'd make it presentable though. <br><br>

					At this stage I'm leaning towards idea 2 as I can see an obvious path of execution.


					<br> <br> <br>

					<i><b> Wednesday, October 3, 2018 </b></i> <br> 

					So moving forward I've had a few more ideas but I've finally settled on one, I've decided I'm going to make some interactive physical websites. For instance I want to make a YouTube video webpage that has a printed flip book that can be used to simulate a video, and a comment input field that can be pulled up and pasted under the video as if the user had made a comment. I'm thinking of creating this with a mix of cardboard and paper layered with movable pieces to simulate different interactions. <br> <br>

					I could use this to discuss the theme of internet restrictions such as youtube copyright or community guidlines, taking it into the physical space removes these obligations. This is in the spirit of the Yama-ichi so I think I'll approach it from this angle.

				<p> <b><i> Saturday, October 6, 2018 </b></i> <br> 
				So I got a bunch of materials together and designed my first prototype for my physical YouTube page. I used foam core for the base and pasted a print of a customised YouTube UI over top, then found the most ridiculous video I could find on YouTube for my flip book. First attempt at the flip book was okay, I learned that for it to work properly the width of the frame needs to get narrower towards the back to allow for a smooth execution, it would probably be good to try with thicker paper as well, so that the frame returns to its natural form and doesn't bend upwards. My current comment system is a start but I think a sturdier input bay is needed, and maybe try using clear file plastic to hold the comment after its posted. Below is a storyboard of my prototype: </p>

					Going forward with my design, last week's group discussion made me think about what other interactive features I could add, but also I know I want to enhance the features I have already. I decided to go back to the drawing board to redesign my comment feature. <br> <br>

				Because the flip book sticks out from the page I thought if I made other parts of the page 3D this could help with functionality as well as aesthetic balance. The idea I decided to go with was have the comment input as part of the right sidebar, with a  stack of blank comment blocks that are hidden by the related videos on top. The user can then write the comment here and remove the block, inserting it into a plastic box on the left, which creates a comment thread when multiple comments are stacked. I did some quick sketches on photoshop to get a better idea in my head of what this could be, and next I started rough prototyping this idea to see if it would work in the way I wanted it to and if it would be achievable with my chosen materials. </p>

					This quick exercise made me confident that with a few adjustments I'd be able to get it how I wanted it, and could start factoring it into my new layout design. Moving onto the next feature, I thought about implementing a subscribe button but couldn't think of a good way to give any meaning to it, so I decided to focus on a like/dislike button which is a more simplistic concept. Taking Stefan's advice from class I went to jaycar to get a three point switch so that I could have a like/dislike rocker that would have a default neutral position. Unfortunately I tried to break the switch to make it flatter and fit into my foam core base, and this ended with me breaking the switch mechanic altogether (don't know why I didn't think of that). Not being keen to spend another $15I decided to accept defeat and think up a different idea. <br> <br>

					I decided to go with a foam slider that used a cutout from the base to slide between like or dislike, the idea being that the printed layout would cover this slider except for a small window to show the red or green. I experimented with using a "touch" input for this where you'd drag your finger across to change the state, but I found this to be clunky and ineffective, so instead I went with the idea of a handle so the user can easily drag it. <br> <br>

				Moving into creating what I hope to be a final, I redesigned my YouTube layout to factor in the new design choices, having 2 seperate prints - one to be the final finish, and the other to help with the correct placement/printing of the like slider.

					Next I got to work on assembling my design and seeing if all the different functions worked as planned. It's look good so far but a few things I'm not 100% happy with. For starters it was very challenging to get everything straight, and there are some aesthetical imperfections that I'd like to change. It mostly functions as expected, however the like slider could be more robust, and the comment thread doesnt always stack correct, sometimes the blocks stop diagonally. Only big issue is that the right sidebar being 3D makes it difficult to use the flipbook and I could see this holding the design back from properly functioning and more of a "you get the idea" type thing. My solution to this at the moment is maybe  have a shelf that the flipbook sits on, allowing it to be removed and used properly.

				So as said in my previous post, the flipbook wasn't all that usable if attached to the page, the solution being to have it sit on the page as a module but with the ability to detach it in order to use it properly. This has proven to be hard because the video box sits directly above the like slider which makes the bottom a fragile area. My first solution was to come at it from the side with a box like thing to hold the flipbook in place. This didn't work as it wasn't balanced enough to hold the weight and the flipbook would just fall out. <br> <br>

				I decided next that I would use velcro instead, with strips of velcro attached to the flipbook and the base to easily attach and remove. This however did not work as expected, the adhesive I used to attach the velcro was weaker than the velcro and resulted in the strips just being ripped off. Running out of time I went out and grabbed some small fridge magnets and super glue, hoping I can find a combination of super glue, magnets, or velcro that will actually work. Before finishing I wanted to create an upload video feature that uses a blank flip book, so hopefully I can finalise this page and actually have time to get that done.

				So here we are with the finished product. My magnet idea worked even better than I expected, holding the flipbook comfortably and being really easy to remove and attach. Some other final touches I made was attach an extra layer of foamcore to the back to hold everything in and make the like slider more robust, and also attached cardboard strip around the permiter to hide my cutting imperfections and give it a slightly more refined finish. The last thing to do was create a base, which I made using foam and my leftover velcro. This had the same issue as my velcro before, but it served its purpose for the day of the Yama-Ichi, and the only reason it needed to be detachable was so I could transport it easier.

				<p> Reflecting on this project, it was definitely a step out of my comfort zone going into the physical realm. I felt like I didn't account enough time for all the things that could go wrong, and unlike in the digital sphere where you could solve it in one sitting, this often meant going out and buying more materials. I am happy with what I created, but slightly disappointed I wasn't able to bring in extra features and pages, and that my neatness with crafts isn't as prestine as I would like. Either way it was a learning experience and I enjoyed the process.
